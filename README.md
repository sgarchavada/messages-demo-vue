### Note

In this demo I am using [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide/) Mock API for adding message to users.
which is not actually storing message to server, but it will be faked as if. you can check the jsonplaceholder guide for more info.

Important: resource will not be really updated on the server but it will be faked as if.
